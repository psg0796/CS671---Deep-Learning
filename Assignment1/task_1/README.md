* ### `color` :- for color of image (ble and red)
* ### `r` :- forcounting the number of image of each classification

## Loops
We have used angle ,length ,width , color and varition as 1st 2nd 2rd and 4th loop respectively
## Inside loops
We have taken random center for each varition and then apply different varition over it and saved
it to the folder
