Running this script will determine the final positions and velocities of the particles when the particles reaches a particular threshold of their distances. 

## Requirements
* numpy
* tensorflow

## Function Definitions

### `main()`
This is the driver function of the program. It loads the input data and also the computational graph required for the problem. Finally there is a tensor flow session for the execution of the computational graph.
